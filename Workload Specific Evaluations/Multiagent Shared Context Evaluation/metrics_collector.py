"""
MetricsCollector — instruments memory/handoffs/time/tokens in  Multi-agent shared-context evaluation.

Structure Terminology:
  - TurnRecord: one user message → all agent work → final output
  - AgentRecord: one agent call within a turn (handoff, memory read, response)

Metric categories:
  1. Memory Context Metrics (LLM-as-judge)
  2. Memory Latency Metrics (timers + token counts)


What MetricsCollector does
------------
1. Records the context flow — for every agent call it captures what the
   agent was asked (handoff), what it read from memory, and what it produced.
   This gives you a full trace of how information moved through the system.

2. Scores context quality with an LLM judge — an LLM evaluates each
   agent call on six dimensions: Was the context fresh? Was the handoff
   complete? Did the agent use what it read? Is what it wrote accurate?
   How much context was wasted? Do agents agree on key facts?

3. Measures coordination overhead — timers and token counts show how
   much of each agent’s work is spent on memory I/O vs actual reasoning,
   so you can spot when shared memory becomes a bottleneck.

Memory-backend agnostic — works the same whether agents share a Python list,
AgentCore, or any other store. The notebooks wire up the memory layer; this
module just evaluates what flowed through it.
